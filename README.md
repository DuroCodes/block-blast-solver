# Block Blast Solver

A mostly functional solver for the game Block Blast.

I do not and will not provide support for actually playing the game, since that ruins the fun of it. This is just a tool to help you solve the puzzles (which I think is okay).

Besides, it doesn't work for all puzzles yet, so you'll still have to do some of the work yourself!

> [!WARNING]
> Not all grids are solved yet, but it works for the most part.
